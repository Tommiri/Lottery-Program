# Lottery program
A simple lottery program I created for an assignment on our C++ Basics course. Expect to find some bugs since this was the first "larger" C++ program I've ever programmed. I still wanted to put it on display, as I was proud of my work when I created it and it took me a decent chunk of time.
## Functionality
* The entire program is in Finnish
* You can choose whether you want to play with computer generated numbers or your own
* If you choose to play with your own numbers, choose 7 lottery numbers and 3 bonus numbers
* The program will generate random winning numbers and display how much you've won after checking for matches with your numbers
